# TODO - Task Management

## Methodology

This TODO follows a **phase-based, iterative DevOps approach** where tasks are managed dynamically rather than as a static list.

### Working Process

1. **Phase-Based Workflow**: We work on one phase at a time, focusing efforts and completing each phase before moving to the next
2. **Dynamic Task Sourcing**: Tasks are pulled from project documents in `/docs` directory as needed
3. **Iterative Loop**: Each phase follows an iterative cycle:
   - Plan � Implement � Test � Review � Deploy � Retrospective
4. **Living Document**: This TODO is continuously updated as phases evolve and new insights emerge

### Task Categories

Tasks are organized by their current phase:
- **Phase 0**: Planning and Architecture
- **Phase 1**: Core Implementation
- **Phase 2**: Integration and Testing
- **Phase 3**: Optimization and Refinement
- **Phase 4**: Documentation and Deployment

### DevOps Principles

- **Continuous Integration**: Small, frequent updates
- **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks
- **Collaboration**: Tasks are transparent and shared
- **Feedback Loops**: Regular review and adjustment of priorities
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Document everything

## Completed Phases

### Phase 0: Initial Setup 
- [x] Repository initialization
- [x] GitHub publication under AxiumForge organization
- [x] Documentation structure (CHANGELOG, RAG, TODO)
- [x] Project methodology documentation

---

## Future Phases

<!-- Phases are defined iteratively based on /docs project documents -->

---

## Notes

- Refer to `/docs` for detailed project specifications and requirements
- Each phase should have clear entry and exit criteria
- Tasks are added/removed dynamically as understanding evolves
- Regular retrospectives help refine the process
